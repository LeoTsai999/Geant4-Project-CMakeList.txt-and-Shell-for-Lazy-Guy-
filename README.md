These two file is for those who programing Geant4 project, and don't wan't to set CMakeList.txt for each project.
The CMakeList.txt file will automatically get your project name, so you don't need to set mannually.
To use them, you just need to copy them into your geant4 project directory, and use "bash RunG4.sh" in the terminal.


NOTE: TO USE THESE TOOLS, YOUR PROJECT DIRECTORY MUST HAVE AT LEAST
